# cs7641_assignments

Contained here is the code-only assets for the famous CS7641 class at Gerogia Tech OMSCS.  It was stressed during the course of the class that sharing code and raw data used for the ML models is fine.  The actual write-ups analysis papers are **NOT** included here.  Feel free to post a question or to me or through the issues tab for this github repo.

## Assignments
1. [Assignment1 Supervised Learning](assignment1) Used Python with [ScikitLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
1. [Assignment2 Randomized Optimization](assignment1) Used Java with [ABIGAIL](https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL)
1. [Assignment3 Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction](assignment1)  Used Python with [ScikitLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
1. [Assignment4 Markov Decision Processes MDP](assignment1) Used Java with [BURLAP]https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap()

## Environment setup.

**Python** I included a copy of my python requirements.txt file. You can do a full pip install with `pip3 install -f requirements.txt`
**Java** For the projects that use Java, I wrapped them in gradlew.  So simply runing `./gradlew build` will be enough to downlaod all the depenencies and have a running environment
